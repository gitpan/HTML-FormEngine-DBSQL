HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL version 1.01
====================================

DBSQL.pm is a exentsion of HTML::FormEngine, that means it inherits
all functionality from HTML::FormEngine and adds some new features.

In web development form data is mostly used to update a database. For
example most guestbooks or any similar webapplications store the
entered data in a database. Often very large forms are needed,
e.g. when the user should provide his personal data to subscribe to an
certain service.

In most cases a SQL database is used. If you don't now anything about
SQL databases or you're not using such things, this module will hardly
help you. But if you do, you'll know that every record, that you want
to store in a certain SQL database table, has to have certain fields
and these fields must contain data of an certain type (datatype).  So
the tables structure already defines how a form that wants to add data
to this table might look like (in case that you don't want to process
the whole data before adding it to the table).

DBSQL.pm reads out the tables structure and creates a form definition
for HTML::FormEngine. It also helps you in communicating with the
database (e.g. functions for automatically inserting and updating are
provided).

NOTE: Due to a consequent redesign FormEngine::DBSQL 1.0 is not
compatible to older versions. Please read the MIGRATING file (which
you find in the distribution near to this file) for help on migrating
your old scripts to FormEngine::DBSQL >=1.0.

Please see the POD for additional information.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, type:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

If you need gettext support, copy the content of the locale directory
to your systems locale directory, you have to overwrite the file that
is already there from HTML::FormEngine.  If your locale directory
isn't /usr/share/locale, you have to adopt the path through the skins
constructor.
