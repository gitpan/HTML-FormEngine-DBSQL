HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL version 0.1
===================================

DBSQL.pm is a exentsion of HTML::FormEngine, that means it inherits
all functionality from HTML::FormEngine and adds some new features.

In web development, form data is mostly used to update a database. For
example most guestbooks or any similar webapplications store the
entered data in a database. Often very large forms are needed,
e.g. when the user should provide his personal data to subscribe to an
certain service.

In most cases a SQL database is used. If you don't now anything about
SQL databases or you're not using such things, this module will hardly
help you. But if you do, you'll know that every record, that you want
to store in a certain SQL database table, has to have certain fields
and these fields must contain data of an certain type (datatype).  So
the tables structure already defines how a form, that wants to add
data to this table, might look like (in case that you don't want to
process the whole data before adding it to the table).

DBSQL.pm reads out the tables structure and creates a form definition
for HTML::FormEngine.

Please see the POD for additional information.
