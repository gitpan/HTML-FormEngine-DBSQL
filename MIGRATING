Please also read the MIGRATING file of HTML::FormEngine, this file
only tells you the HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL related changes that you
have to do in your scripts when migrating from version < 1.0 to
version >= 1.0.  Its possible that i forgot something, so if you
experience problems tell me about it.

First of all you have to replace every occurance of
'HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL::PGSQL' with 'HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL',
resp. remove it since the PGSQL package doesn't exist
anymore. HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL now uses perls DBI database
abstraction to be compatible to all databases that are supported by
DBI. Unfortunately HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL was only tested with
PostgreSQL, please tell me about your experience with other DBMS.

$form is the HTML::FormEngine::DBSQL object, on the left side of the
'=>' is the old versions command, on the right is written what you
have to put instead in the new version.

$form->dbsql_set_secret('mysecret')  =>  $form->get_skin_obj()->set_dbsql_secret('mysecret')

$form->dbsql_set_show_default(0) => $form->dbsql_set_show_default(0); $form->dbsql_set_write_null_fields(2) (read POD!!)

Instead of calling 'get_skin_obj()' you can create a new skin object,
call the needed methods on it and set it with 'set_skin_obj()'.

Normaly its better to use the dbsql_hidden template instead of the
hidden template.
